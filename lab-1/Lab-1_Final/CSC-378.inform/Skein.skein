-------------------Important Info---------------------------

 Starting there is  TW for mental health related topics. This game is a game about disassociation and could be a trigger for some. 

The score in the game is your sanity/ self image. You start with 5, and can check it with score. Get too high and something bad may happen. In other words try to get a low score. Another part of the scoring is that you will consistently take damage to your sanity, sometimes even when you do something good you&apos;ll be punished because you got another one of those pings... it sucks, I know.

You will need to know a special part of this game, that is the phone. The phone is a room not an object so treat it as such. Throughout the game text will be highlighted... this may mean you can interact with typing it out ;)

I think somethings wrong...
Something is wrong... by Luke Rowe
Release 1 / Serial number 230123 / Inform 7 v10.1.2 / D

Phone
You are on your phone, scrolling endlessly with no end in sight.

A water main broke, leaving New Orleans without drinking water, and the flooding here is getting worse after waters from Lake Pontchartrain broke through a levee. 
 scroll 
 The Crips &amp; Bloods tried to establish themselves here, and these guys killed them. Simple as that-gone! See you later! 
 scroll 
 Music Intro: Steve Lacy I wish I knew you wanted me I wish I knew, I wish I knew you wanted me I wish I knew, I wish I knew you wanted me 

Slowly you begin to hear a high pitch sound which you could listen to possibly. You start feeling an unease. Maybe you should put the phone down.

You could also stay on your phone in your endless lull.  scrolling, maybe that feeling of unease could just be random. Go and see whats going on with your phone.  What time was it again?

 I also have snapchat  I could examine it but... there&apos;s no point, I don&apos;t ever get sent anything.

 You start with 5 sanity load

Phone
You are on your phone, scrolling endlessly with no end in sight. You could possibly keep scrolling diving deeper into the void, the numbing of your mind. Slowly you begin to hear a high pitch sound. You start feeling an unease. Maybe you should put the phone down.

-------------------Important Info---------------------------

The score in the game is bad. Think of it as your sanity load. Get to high and something may happen.

You will need to know some commands, most commands are basic however here are two important ones:

Phone Down, and Phone Up. This is how you access the phone. The phone can only be used in the bedroom, it in itself is a room. Treat it as such and potentially explore it.

I think somethings wrong...
Something is wrong... by Luke Rowe
Release 1 / Serial number 230118 / Inform 7 v10.1.2 / D

Phone
You are on your phone, scrolling endlessly with no end in sight. You could possibly keep scrolling diving deeper into the void, the numbing of your mind.

A water main broke, leaving New Orleans without drinking water, and the flooding here is getting worse after waters from Lake Pontchartrain broke through a levee. 
 scroll 
 The Crips &amp; Bloods tried to establish themselves here, and these guys killed them. Simple as that-gone! See you later! 
 scroll 
 Music Intro: Steve Lacy I wish I knew you wanted me I wish I knew, I wish I knew you wanted me I wish I knew, I wish I knew you wanted me 

Slowly you begin to hear a high pitch sound. You start feeling an unease. Maybe you should put the phone down.

Additionally you could continue to scroll. That feeling of unease could just be random. Go and see whats going on with your phone.

-------------------Important Info---------------------------

The score in the game is bad. Think of it as your sanity load. Get to high and something may happen.

You will need to know some commands, most commands are basic however here are two important ones:

Phone Down, and Phone Up. This is how you access the phone. The phone can only be used in the bedroom, it in itself is a room. Treat it as such and potentially explore it.

I think somethings wrong...
Something is wrong... by Luke Rowe
Release 1 / Serial number 230118 / Inform 7 v10.1.2 / D

Phone
You are on your phone, scrolling endlessly with no end in sight. You could possibly keep scrolling diving deeper into the void, the numbing of your mind.

A water main broke, leaving New Orleans without drinking water, and the flooding here is getting worse after waters from Lake Pontchartrain broke through a levee. 
 scroll 
 The Crips &amp; Bloods tried to establish themselves here, and these guys killed them. Simple as that-gone! See you later! 
 scroll 
 Music Intro: Steve Lacy I wish I knew you wanted me I wish I knew, I wish I knew you wanted me I wish I knew, I wish I knew you wanted me 

Slowly you begin to hear a high pitch sound. You start feeling an unease. Maybe you should put the phone down.

Additionally you could continue to scroll. That feeling of unease could just be random. Go and see whats going on with your phone.

-------------------Important Info---------------------------

 Starting there is  TW for mental health related topics. This game is a game about disassociation and could be a trigger for some. 

The score in the game is your sanity/ self image. You start with 5, and can check it with score. Get too high and something bad may happen. In other words try to get a low score. Another part of the scoring is that you will consistently take damage to your sanity, sometimes even when you do something good you&apos;ll be punished because you got another one of those pings... it sucks, I know.

You will need to know a special part of this game, that is the phone. The phone is a room not an object so treat it as such. Throughout the game text will be highlighted... this may mean you can interact with typing it out ;)

I think somethings wrong...
Something is wrong... by Luke Rowe
Release 1 / Serial number 230123 / Inform 7 v10.1.2 / D

Phone
You are on your phone, scrolling endlessly with no end in sight.

A water main broke, leaving New Orleans without drinking water, and the flooding here is getting worse after waters from Lake Pontchartrain broke through a levee. 
 scroll 
 The Crips &amp; Bloods tried to establish themselves here, and these guys killed them. Simple as that-gone! See you later! 
 scroll 
 Music Intro: Steve Lacy I wish I knew you wanted me I wish I knew, I wish I knew you wanted me I wish I knew, I wish I knew you wanted me 

Slowly you begin to hear a high pitch sound which you could listen to possibly. You start feeling an unease. Maybe you should put the phone down.

You could also stay on your phone in your endless lull.  scrolling, maybe that feeling of unease could just be random. Go and see whats going on with your phone.  What time was it again?

 I also have snapchat  I could open it but... there&apos;s no point, I don&apos;t ever get sent anything.

 You start with 5 sanity load

-------------------Important Info---------------------------

The score in the game is bad. Think of it as your sanity load. Get to high and something may happen.

You will need to know some commands, most commands are basic however here are two important ones:

Phone Down, and Phone Up. This is how you access the phone. The phone can only be used in the bedroom, it in itself is a room. Treat it as such and potentially explore it.

I think somethings wrong...
Something is wrong... by Luke Rowe
Release 1 / Serial number 230118 / Inform 7 v10.1.2 / D

Phone
You are on your phone, scrolling endlessly with no end in sight. You could possibly keep scrolling diving deeper into the void, the numbing of your mind.

A water main broke, leaving New Orleans without drinking water, and the flooding here is getting worse after waters from Lake Pontchartrain broke through a levee. 
 scroll 
 The Crips &amp; Bloods tried to establish themselves here, and these guys killed them. Simple as that-gone! See you later! 
 scroll 
 Music Intro: Steve Lacy I wish I knew you wanted me I wish I knew, I wish I knew you wanted me I wish I knew, I wish I knew you wanted me 

Slowly you begin to hear a high pitch sound. You start feeling an unease. Maybe you should put the phone down.

Additionally you could continue to scroll. That feeling of unease could just be random. Go and see whats going on with your phone. What time was it again?

Your bedroom, the walls look kind of silly. Did the walls stucco always slide like that? Your bathroom is south of the Bedroom, the door to the outside to the east

You can see Bottle (in which is liquid) here.

 Your head throbs, your vision gets blurry. You stare at nothing for a little. You come back to.



    *** You succumb. You stare at the walls around you and you fade. You get pulled in, you don&apos;t come back. You are now stuck. You never will experience anything else but this hell. You can&apos;t move, you can&apos;t think ***


In that game you scored 21 out of a possible 0, in 7 turns.


Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, QUIT or UNDO the last command?

Closet
Kinda running low on clothes... man everything is so outdated, I never get new clothes, I NEVER get anything good for myself, I think I have some things I can wear though...

You gaze at the corner of the closet and stare at how dark it is. Your gaze wanders across the clothing rack, then slowly throughout the rest of it. The felt and fabrics begin to seem like a mirage, fake almost... you get a ping. You snap back to.

Slowly you begin to hear a high pitch sound which you could listen to possibly. You start feeling an unease. Maybe you should put the phone down.

You could also stay on your phone in your endless lull.  scrolling, maybe that feeling of unease could just be random. Go and see whats going on with your phone.  What time was it again?

 I also have snapchat  I could open it but... there&apos;s no point, I don&apos;t ever get sent anything.

Bedroom
Your bedroom, the walls look kind of silly. Did the walls stucco always slide like that? Your bathroom is south of the Bedroom, the closet is to the east, the door to the outside to the northeast

You can see Bottle (in which is liquid) here.



Your head throbs, your vision gets blurry. You stare at nothing for a little. You come back to.

The Bathroom
Your bathroom, it seems kind of small. The corners of the room seem to be swaying inward. Other than that its a normal bathroom with a shower and a mirror that&apos;s refracting some weird looking objects. I probably look like shit.

Self is a man sitting in your head, but your thoughts are jumbled.



 You lose sight of what you are doing. You put your hands up and they look oddly distant. You say:  Are these even my hands?

-------------------Important Info---------------------------

The score in the game is bad. Think of it as your sanity load. Get to high and something may happen.

You will need to know some commands, most commands are basic however here are two important ones:

Phone Down, and Phone Up. This is how you access the phone. The phone can only be used in the bedroom, it in itself is a room. Treat it as such and potentially explore it.

I think somethings wrong...
Something is wrong... by Luke Rowe
Release 1 / Serial number 230118 / Inform 7 v10.1.2 / D

Phone
You are on your phone, scrolling endlessly with no end in sight. You could possibly keep scrolling diving deeper into the void, the numbing of your mind.

A water main broke, leaving New Orleans without drinking water, and the flooding here is getting worse after waters from Lake Pontchartrain broke through a levee. 
 scroll 
 The Crips &amp; Bloods tried to establish themselves here, and these guys killed them. Simple as that-gone! See you later! 
 scroll 
 Music Intro: Steve Lacy I wish I knew you wanted me I wish I knew, I wish I knew you wanted me I wish I knew, I wish I knew you wanted me 

Slowly you begin to hear a high pitch sound. You start feeling an unease. Maybe you should put the phone down.

Additionally you could continue to scroll. That feeling of unease could just be random. Go and see whats going on with your phone. What time was it again?

You put on the Berserk Hoodie.

 You lose sight of what you are doing. You put your hands up and they look oddly distant. You say:

 Are these even my hands?

    *** You took too long, you did the things you knew would make you worse off. You succumb. You stare at the walls around you and you fade. You get pulled in, you don&apos;t come back. You are now stuck. You never will experience anything else but this hell. You can&apos;t move, you can&apos;t think ***


In that game you scored 19 out of a possible 0, in 10 turns.


Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, QUIT or UNDO the last command?

The Bathroom
Your bathroom, it seems kind of small. The corners of the room seem to be swaying inward. Other than that its a normal bathroom with a shower and a mirror that&apos;s refracting some weird looking objects. I probably look like shit.

 You lose sight of what you are doing. You put your hands up and they look oddly distant. You say:  Are these even my hands?



    *** You took too long, you did the things you knew would make you worse off. You succumb. You stare at the walls around you and you fade. You get pulled in, you don&apos;t come back. You are now stuck. You never will experience anything else but this hell. You can&apos;t move, you can&apos;t think ***


In that game you scored 21 out of a possible 0, in 20 turns.


Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, QUIT or UNDO the last command?

-------------------Important Info---------------------------

 Starting there is  TW for mental health related topics. This game is a game about disassociation and could be a trigger for some. 

The score in the game is your sanity/ self image. You start with 5, and can check it with score. Get too high and something bad may happen. In other words try to get a low score. Another part of the scoring is that you will consistently take damage to your sanity, sometimes even when you do something good you&apos;ll be punished because you got another one of those pings... it sucks, I know.

You will need to know a special part of this game, that is the phone. The phone is a room not an object so treat it as such. Throughout the game text will be highlighted... this may mean you can interact with typing it out ;)

I think somethings wrong...
Something is wrong... by Luke Rowe
Release 1 / Serial number 230123 / Inform 7 v10.1.2 / D

Phone
You are on your phone, scrolling endlessly with no end in sight.

A water main broke, leaving New Orleans without drinking water, and the flooding here is getting worse after waters from Lake Pontchartrain broke through a levee. 
 scroll 
 The Crips &amp; Bloods tried to establish themselves here, and these guys killed them. Simple as that-gone! See you later! 
 scroll 
 Music Intro: Steve Lacy I wish I knew you wanted me I wish I knew, I wish I knew you wanted me I wish I knew, I wish I knew you wanted me 

Slowly you begin to hear a high pitch sound which you could listen to possibly. You start feeling an unease. Maybe you should put the phone down.

You could also stay on your phone in your endless lull.  scrolling, maybe that feeling of unease could just be random. Go and see whats going on with your phone.  What time was it again?

 I also have snapchat  I could open it but... there&apos;s no point, I don&apos;t ever get sent anything.

 You start with 5 sanity load

Your bedroom, the walls look kind of silly. Did the walls stucco always slide like that? Your bathroom is south of the Bedroom, the closet is to the east, the door to the outside to the northeast

You can see Bottle (in which is liquid) here.

The Bathroom
Your bathroom, it seems kind of small. The corners of the room seem to be swaying inward. Other than that its a normal bathroom with a shower. Nothing special. I probably look like shit.

Slowly you begin to hear a high pitch sound. You start feeling an unease. Maybe you should put the phone down.

You could also stay on your phone in your endless lull.  scrolling , maybe that feeling of unease could just be random. Go and see whats going on with your phone.  What time was it again?

 I also have snapchat  I could go to... not really  a point probably.

-------------------Important Info---------------------------

The score in the game is bad. Think of it as your sanity load. Get to high and something may happen.

You will need to know some commands, most commands are basic however here are two important ones:

Phone Down, and Phone Up. This is how you access the phone. The phone can only be used in the bedroom, it in itself is a room. Treat it as such and potentially explore it.

I think somethings wrong...
Something is wrong... by Luke Rowe
Release 1 / Serial number 230118 / Inform 7 v10.1.2 / D

Phone
You are on your phone, scrolling endlessly with no end in sight.

A water main broke, leaving New Orleans without drinking water, and the flooding here is getting worse after waters from Lake Pontchartrain broke through a levee. 
 scroll 
 The Crips &amp; Bloods tried to establish themselves here, and these guys killed them. Simple as that-gone! See you later! 
 scroll 
 Music Intro: Steve Lacy I wish I knew you wanted me I wish I knew, I wish I knew you wanted me I wish I knew, I wish I knew you wanted me 

Slowly you begin to hear a high pitch sound. You start feeling an unease. Maybe you should put the phone down.

You could also stay on your phone in your endless lull.  scrolling , maybe that feeling of unease could just be random. Go and see whats going on with your phone.  What time was it again?

 I also have snapchat  I could go to... not really  a point probably.

 You start with 5 sanity load
