-------------------Important Info---------------------------

 Starting there is  TW for mental health related topics. This game is a game about disassociation and could be a trigger for some. 

The score in the game is bad. Think of it as your sanity load. Get to high and something may happen. Try to get a low score.

You will need to know some commands, most commands are basic however here are two important ones:

Phone Down, and Phone Up. This is how you access the phone. The phone can only be used in the bedroom, it in itself is a room. Treat it as such and potentially explore it.

I think somethings wrong...
Something is wrong... by Luke Rowe
Release 1 / Serial number 230118 / Inform 7 v10.1.2 / D

Phone
You are on your phone, scrolling endlessly with no end in sight.

A water main broke, leaving New Orleans without drinking water, and the flooding here is getting worse after waters from Lake Pontchartrain broke through a levee. 
 scroll 
 The Crips &amp; Bloods tried to establish themselves here, and these guys killed them. Simple as that-gone! See you later! 
 scroll 
 Music Intro: Steve Lacy I wish I knew you wanted me I wish I knew, I wish I knew you wanted me I wish I knew, I wish I knew you wanted me 

Slowly you begin to hear a high pitch sound. You start feeling an unease. Maybe you should put the phone down.

You could also stay on your phone in your endless lull.  scrolling, maybe that feeling of unease could just be random. Go and see whats going on with your phone.  What time was it again?

 I also have snapchat  I could go to... not really  a point probably.

 You start with 5 sanity load

Phone
You are on your phone, scrolling endlessly with no end in sight. You could possibly keep scrolling diving deeper into the void, the numbing of your mind. Slowly you begin to hear a high pitch sound. You start feeling an unease. Maybe you should put the phone down.

You look back up at your room there is a big blur and your eyes take time to readjust. You flop back into your bed as if picking up the bottle was too exhausting. You begin to get a headache.

-------------------Important Info---------------------------

The score in the game is bad. Think of it as your sanity load. Get to high and something may happen.

You will need to know some commands, most commands are basic however here are two important ones:

Phone Down, and Phone Up. This is how you access the phone. The phone can only be used in the bedroom, it in itself is a room. Treat it as such and potentially explore it.

I think somethings wrong...
Something is wrong... by Luke Rowe
Release 1 / Serial number 230118 / Inform 7 v10.1.2 / D

Phone
You are on your phone, scrolling endlessly with no end in sight. You could possibly keep scrolling diving deeper into the void, the numbing of your mind.

A water main broke, leaving New Orleans without drinking water, and the flooding here is getting worse after waters from Lake Pontchartrain broke through a levee. 
 scroll 
 The Crips &amp; Bloods tried to establish themselves here, and these guys killed them. Simple as that-gone! See you later! 
 scroll 
 Music Intro: Steve Lacy I wish I knew you wanted me I wish I knew, I wish I knew you wanted me I wish I knew, I wish I knew you wanted me 

Slowly you begin to hear a high pitch sound. You start feeling an unease. Maybe you should put the phone down.

Additionally you could continue to scroll. That feeling of unease could just be random. Go and see whats going on with your phone.

-------------------Important Info---------------------------

The score in the game is bad. Think of it as your sanity load. Get to high and something may happen.

You will need to know some commands, most commands are basic however here are two important ones:

Phone Down, and Phone Up. This is how you access the phone. The phone can only be used in the bedroom, it in itself is a room. Treat it as such and potentially explore it.

I think somethings wrong...
Something is wrong... by Luke Rowe
Release 1 / Serial number 230118 / Inform 7 v10.1.2 / D

Phone
You are on your phone, scrolling endlessly with no end in sight. You could possibly keep scrolling diving deeper into the void, the numbing of your mind.

A water main broke, leaving New Orleans without drinking water, and the flooding here is getting worse after waters from Lake Pontchartrain broke through a levee. 
 scroll 
 The Crips &amp; Bloods tried to establish themselves here, and these guys killed them. Simple as that-gone! See you later! 
 scroll 
 Music Intro: Steve Lacy I wish I knew you wanted me I wish I knew, I wish I knew you wanted me I wish I knew, I wish I knew you wanted me 

Slowly you begin to hear a high pitch sound. You start feeling an unease. Maybe you should put the phone down.

Additionally you could continue to scroll. That feeling of unease could just be random. Go and see whats going on with your phone.

You are on your phone, scrolling endlessly with no end in sight. You could possibly keep scrolling diving deeper into the void, the numbing of your mind. Slowly you begin to hear a high pitch sound. You start feeling an unease. Maybe you should put the phone down. (phone down)

Additionally you could continue to scroll. Maybe like some content? See whats going on with your phone.

-------------------Important Info---------------------------

The score in the game is bad. Think of it as your sanity load. Get to high and something may happen.

You will need to know some commands, most commands are basic however here are two important ones:

Phone Down, and Phone Up. This is how you access the phone. The phone can only be used in the bedroom, it in itself is a room. Treat it as such and potentially explore it.

I think somethings wrong...
Something is wrong... by Luke Rowe
Release 1 / Serial number 230118 / Inform 7 v10.1.2 / D

Phone
You are on your phone, scrolling endlessly with no end in sight. You could possibly keep scrolling diving deeper into the void, the numbing of your mind.

A water main broke, leaving New Orleans without drinking water, and the flooding here is getting worse after waters from Lake Pontchartrain broke through a levee. 
 scroll 
 The Crips &amp; Bloods tried to establish themselves here, and these guys killed them. Simple as that-gone! See you later! 
 scroll 
 Music Intro: Steve Lacy I wish I knew you wanted me I wish I knew, I wish I knew you wanted me I wish I knew, I wish I knew you wanted me 

Slowly you begin to hear a high pitch sound. You start feeling an unease. Maybe you should put the phone down.

Additionally you could continue to scroll. That feeling of unease could just be random. Go and see whats going on with your phone. What time was it again?

    *** You succumb. You stare at the walls around you and you fade. You get pulled in, you don&apos;t come back. You are now stuck. You never will experience anything else but this hell. You can&apos;t move, you can&apos;t think ***

    *** You succumb. You stare at the walls around you and you fade. You get pulled in, you don&apos;t come back. You are now stuck. You never will experience anything else but this hell. You can&apos;t move, you can&apos;t think ***


In that game you scored 26 out of a possible 0, in 13 turns.


Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, QUIT or UNDO the last command?

-------------------Important Info---------------------------

The score in the game is bad. Think of it as your sanity load. Get to high and something may happen.

You will need to know some commands, most commands are basic however here are two important ones:

Phone Down, and Phone Up. This is how you access the phone. The phone can only be used in the bedroom, it in itself is a room. Treat it as such and potentially explore it.

I think somethings wrong...
Something is wrong... by Luke Rowe
Release 1 / Serial number 230118 / Inform 7 v10.1.2 / D

Phone
You are on your phone, scrolling endlessly with no end in sight. You could possibly keep scrolling diving deeper into the void, the numbing of your mind.

A water main broke, leaving New Orleans without drinking water, and the flooding here is getting worse after waters from Lake Pontchartrain broke through a levee. 
 scroll 
 The Crips &amp; Bloods tried to establish themselves here, and these guys killed them. Simple as that-gone! See you later! 
 scroll 
 Music Intro: Steve Lacy I wish I knew you wanted me I wish I knew, I wish I knew you wanted me I wish I knew, I wish I knew you wanted me 

Slowly you begin to hear a high pitch sound. You start feeling an unease. Maybe you should put the phone down.

Additionally you could continue to scroll. That feeling of unease could just be random. Go and see whats going on with your phone. What time was it again?

Slowly you begin to hear a high pitch sound. You start feeling an unease. Maybe you should put the phone down.

You could also stay on your phone in your endless lull.  scrolling , maybe that feeling of unease could just be random. Go and see whats going on with your phone.  What time was it again?

 I also have snapchat  I could go to... not really  a point probably.

-------------------Important Info---------------------------

The score in the game is bad. Think of it as your sanity load. Get to high and something may happen.

You will need to know some commands, most commands are basic however here are two important ones:

Phone Down, and Phone Up. This is how you access the phone. The phone can only be used in the bedroom, it in itself is a room. Treat it as such and potentially explore it.
